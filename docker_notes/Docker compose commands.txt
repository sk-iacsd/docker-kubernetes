docker-compose.yml helps to keep the bidge, network, data shareing between multiple containers. provides access all containers with each other
1) version : '3' === this is required to define the docker-composer version

2) services: this contains all the container we want to use in our application
	a) Container name
		1) image: OR build: path of Dockerfile
		2) port: port numbers to connection the local machine ports with container's '8080:8080'
		3) depends_on: depends on the container which is required to be created fist then this one
		4) restart: ther are four policies 
			a) "no" : No restart even in case of any failure
			b) alway : Always restart even if it crashes
			c) on-failure : Restart only if container fails with an error code
			d) unless-stopped : Always restart unless forcefully stopped.

3) to override the startup command from the image use command key
	example:
		react-test:
			build: 
			context: .
			dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
			volumes:
			- /app/node_modules
			- .:/app
			command: ["npm", "run", "test"]
		 ------- here the existing startup command for the Dockerfile.dev was CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
